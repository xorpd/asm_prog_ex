Structured Branching
---------------------

Welcome to the Structured Branching exercises section.
This exercise has three parts: Code reading, Code writing and Code fixing.

Do the Code reading first. It will show you examples of structured branching
patterns. Then move on to the Code Writing section, where you are going to write
some code yourself. Finally, you will have the opportunity to fix some spaghetti
code yourself.

Pay attention to the different patterns of structured branching: IF conditionals
and LOOPS.

Have fun :)
