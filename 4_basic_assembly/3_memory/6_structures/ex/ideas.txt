Ideas for read code:

- (Bathrooms) Get two values as input, which represent a point.
  Then find the closest point out of all the points in a predefined array.
  -- done.

- (Vector Adder) Adds two 2 dimensional vectors.

- Segments intersection:
  Get a number n and then n segments (Pairs of numbers).
  Output the intersection of all the segments.

  At all times I will keep the intersection in memory, using a struct.

- structs and unions playground: Show strange things with the labels, to make
  sure that the reader understands what really happens with the labels.
  - What is the size of the following structure (Contains unions inside).
  -- done.


Ideas for write code:

- Read 4 coordinates to define a rectangle (twice), and find out which rectangle
  has a larger area.

- Read 4 coordinates twice, and find out if the two rectangles intersect.

- Lexicographic sort of points.
