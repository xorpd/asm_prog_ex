Structures exercises
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Welcome to the Structures exercises section.
The exercises contain two parts: Code reading and Code writing.
Begin with the Code reading, and later move on to the Code writing.

Note that in the Read Code section a new subroutine was introduced:
print_delimiter. This subroutine prints a delimiter "========" to the console.
It helps to create a nicer looking output. (This subroutine is inside the
training.inc file, if you were wondering.)

Have fun :)
