Defining memory
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Welcome to the defining memory exercises section.

You are given a few binary files. For every file:

0. Use your hex editor to open it.
1. Take a look at the file. Understand the patterns.
2. Create an asm file that will assemble into this exact binary file.
3. Assemble your asm file and check yourself.

Have fun :)
