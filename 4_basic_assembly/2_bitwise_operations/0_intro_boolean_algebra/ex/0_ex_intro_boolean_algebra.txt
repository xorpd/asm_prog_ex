Introduction to boolean algebra
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Welcome to the "Introduction to boolean algebra" exercises section.
We use the following symbols in this exercise:

V - OR
^ - AND
¬ - NOT
+ - XOR


0.  Calculate the following expressions:

    0.0   ¬0
    0.1   (¬0)^1
    0.2   (0^1)V(¬0)
    0.3   0V1V0V0
    0.4   1+1
    0.5   ((¬1)^(0V1))V((¬0)^(1^1))
    0.6   (0+1)^(1+0)


1.  Build truth tables and Venn diagrams for the following expressions:

    1.0   (¬a)Va
    1.1   (¬a)^a
    1.2   (¬a)^b
    1.3   aVbVc
    1.4   ((¬a)^b)V((¬b)^a)
    1.5   ¬((¬a)V(¬b))


2.  Basic properties:
    Prove the following statements. This could be done, for example, using Truth
    tables.

    2.0   OR's Associative law: aV(bVc) = (aVb)VC
    2.1   Distributive law: aV(b^c) = (aVb)^(aVc)
    2.2   De Morgan's law: aVb = ¬((¬a)^(¬b))
    2.3   XOR's associative law: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c)
    2.4   AND and XOR distributive law: a^(b+c) = (a^b)+(a^c)


3.  Representing operators using other operators.
    
    3.0   How could you represent a^b using the ¬ and V operators?
          How could you represent aVb using the ¬ and ^ operators?

    3.1   Representing ¬:
      3.1.0   Show that in any expression that contains only the operators ^ and
              V, if all the variables are 0 then the result is 0.

      3.1.1   Prove that ¬a could not be represented using only the ^ and V
              operators.


4.  Bonus: Disjunctive normal form.

    4.0   Create an expression E(a,b) with the variables a,b and with the
          operators ^,V,¬ that has the following property: E(a,b) = 1 only if
          a=0 and b=1. (It is 0 otherwise).

    4.1   Create an expression T(a,b,c) with the variables a,b,c that has the
          following property: T(a,b,c) = 1 only if a=1,b=0,c=1.

    4.2   Create an expression G(a,b,c,d) with the variables a,b,c,d that has
          the following property: G(a,b,c,d) = 1 only if a=0,b=1,c=1,d=0.

    4.3   Describe how to create an expression Q(a_1,a_2,...,a_s) that
          has the following property: Q(a_1,a_2,...,a_s) = 1 only if a_1=k_1,
          a_2=k_2 , ... , a_s=k_s for some constant bits k_1,...,k_s.

    4.4   Every operator L(a_1,a_2,...,a_s) with variables a_1,...,a_s has a
          truth table that could be calculated for every assignment of values
          into the variables a_1,...,a_s.

          Given the truth table of the operator L, infer how to create an
          expression that equals the operator L for every choice of values for
          a_1,...,a_s.

    4.5   Conclude that ^,V,¬ could be used to represent any possible boolean
          operator.

          Infer using 3.0 that either {^,¬} or {V,¬} would be enough.


5.  The XOR operator.

    5.0   Show that ¬x = x+1

    5.1   Find 5 bits a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5 such that each bit a_i equals to the
          XOR of the rest of the bits.

          Bonus:  Could you do the same for any n bits? 
                  How many such sets of n bits exist?

    5.2   Find a representation for aVb using the operator ^, the operator +
          (XOR) and the bit 1.

          HINT: Use the solution of question 5.0.

    5.3   Infer that every expression that can be represented using V,^,¬ could
          be represented using +(XOR),^ and the number 1.

          Bonus: Show (Using the distributive property of XOR and AND) that we
          need at most one instance of the number "1" in such expression.

    5.4   Find all the solutions to the following set of equations, in a,b,c.
          Note that each solution (a,b,c) that you find should satisfy all the
          three equations at the same time.

          (Recall that here + means XOR)
          
          a + b = 1
          b + c = 1
          a + c = 0


6.  Simplify the following expressions:
    You may use any of the laws that we have learned about, use truth tables,
    Venn diagrams or even try to guess.

    You can use Truth tables to make sure that your answer is correct.

    
    6.0   (a^b)V(aVb)

    6.1   (aVb)^(¬((¬a)^(¬b)))

    6.2   (¬((a^b)V(¬c)))+c

    6.3   (b^(¬(a^b)))Va


7.  Bonus: The NAND operator.
    
    We define the binary operator NAND as following:
    a NAND b = ¬(a^b)
    (NAND is a shorthand for NOT AND).

    7.0   Write a truth table for the NAND operator.

    7.1   Find a way to represent ¬a only using the NAND operator.

    7.2   Find a way to represent a^b only using the NAND operator.

    7.3   As in 4, Conclude that the NAND operator could be used to represent
          any boolean operator.


8.  Bonus: Counting boolean operators.

    8.0   How many possible boolean operators are there which have one bit
          argument, and one bit output?

          How many are there with two bit arguments, and one bit output?

    8.1   How many possible boolean operators with k arguments and one bit
          output exist?


Have fun :)
