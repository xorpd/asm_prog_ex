Bitwise operations - Practical bit games
----------------------------------------

Write code
@@@@@@@@@@

In the following exercises you will be asked to write actual programs that
execute some work over given inputs and produce outputs.
Use the print_eax_binary.asm file as a template to be able to receive numeric
input and produce numeric output, both as hex or binary.

You can just copy the print_eax_binary.asm file and use it as a starting point
for any of your solutions to the following exercises.

For every program that you write, make sure that it passes the assembly
process successfuly, and then try to run it to make sure that it behaves as
expected.


0.  Even or Odd:

    0.0   Write a program that takes a number x as input, and returns:
          - 0 if x is even.
          - 1 if x is odd. 

    0.1   Write a program that takes three numbers x,y,z as input, and returns:
          - 0 if (x+y+z) is even.
          - 1 if (x+y+z) is odd.

          (Note that here + means arithmetic addition).
          Do it without actually adding the numbers.
          HINT: Use the XOR instruction.


1.  Bit counting:
    
    Write a program that takes a number (of size 4 bytes) x as input, and then
    counts the amount of "1" bits in even locations inside the number x. We
    assume that the rightmost bit has location 0, and the leftmost bit has a
    location of 31.

    Example:
      
      if x == {111011011}_2, then we only count the bits with stars under them.
               * * * * *
               8 6 4 2 0 

      Hence we get the result of 4.


2.  Bit reverse:

    Write a program that takes a number (of size 4 bytes) x as input, and then
    reverses all the bits of x, and outputs the result. By reversing all bits we
    mean that the bit with original location i will move to location 31-i.

    Small example (for the 8 bit case):

      if x == {01001111}_2, then the output is {11110010}_2.

      In this example we reversed only 8 bits. Your program will be able to
      reverse 32 bits.


3.  Sum of distances:
    
    For a binary number x, we define the "sum of 1 distances" to be the sum of
    distances between every two "1" bits in x's binary representation.

    Small example (8 bits):

      x = {10010100}_2
           7  4 2
      
      The total sum of distances: (7-4) + (7-2) + (4-2) = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10


    Create a program that takes a number x (of size 4 bytes) as input, and
    outputs x's "sum of 1 distances".


4.  Rotation using shifts.

    Implement the ror instruction using the shift instructions. You may use any
    bitwise instruction for this task, except for the rotation instructions
    (ror,rol).


5.  Rotation overflow.

    The ror/rol instructions receive two arguments: dest and k. k is the amount
    of bit locations we rotate. (k=1 means rotate one bit location).

    What happens if k is larger than the size of the argument? For example, what
    would the following instructions do:

    5.0   ror   eax,54d

    5.1   rol   bx,19d

    5.2   ror   dh,10d

    5.3   mov   cl,0feh
          ror   edx,cl

    5.4   ror   eax,1001d

    For each of those instructions:
    - Check if it assembles.
    - Write some code that includes that instruction, and find out what it does.
    

6.  Bonus: Identifying powers of two.
    
    6.0   Find the binary representation of the following numbers:
          1,2,4,8,16,32 (Decimal representation).
          What do all those binary representations have in common?

    6.1   Write a program that takes a number x and finds out if this number is
          a power of 2. It outputs 1 if the number is a power of 2, and 0
          otherwise.

    6.2   Try to write that program again, this time without any loops.
          
          HINT: try to decrease the original number by 1.


7.  Bonus: Convert Gray into binary.
    
    In the "Gray" Exercise at the code reading section, we have learned that in
    order to find the Gray code of a number x, we should shift the number x by
    1, and xor the result with the original x value.

    In high level pseudo code: 
      (x >> 1) XOR x.

    In assembly code:
      mov   ecx,eax
      shr   ecx,1
      xor   eax,ecx


    Find a way to reconstruct x from the expression (x >> 1) XOR x.
    Write a program that takes a gray code g as input, and returns the
    corresponding x such that g = (x >> 1) XOR x.

    NOTE that You may need to use a loop in your program.


8.  Bonus: Addition using bitwise operations.

    8.0   You are given two bits a,b. Show that their arithmetic sum is of the
          form (a AND b, a XOR b).

          Example:

          1 + 0 = 01
          And indeed: 0 = 1 AND 0, 1 = 1 XOR 0.


    8.1   Write a program that gets as inputs two numbers x,y (Each of size 4
          bytes), and calculates their arithmetic sum x+y using only bitwise
          instructions. (ADD is not allowed!).

          HINT: Try to divide the addition into 32 iterations.
                In each iteration separate the immediate result and the carry
                bits that are produced from the addition.


Happy coding :)
