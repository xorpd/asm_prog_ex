First instructions
------------------
Welcome to the first exercises regarding writing actual code!
There are two parts for the exercises: Reading code and writing code. There are
a few bonus exercises in the second section, they are not mandatory.

Except for the bonus exercises, make sure that you do all the exercises, to make
sure that you understand the material from the lecture. It should also help you
remember the instructions' names and the register's names.

This time you may use a calculator at any point, if you wish to.


Read some code
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

0.  You are given the initial values of the following registers:
    eax = 0x00000011 , ebx = 0x1234ABCD , ecx = 0x5151DEAD

    Find out the final values of eax, ebx and ecx after running the following
    instructions:

    mov   ah,5Bh
    mov   cx,0BEEFh
    mov   ebx,ecx
    mov   ah,bl


1.  The initial value of eax is 0x1. What is the value of eax after running the
    following instructions?

    add   eax,1
    add   eax,eax
    add   eax,eax


2.  The initial value of eax is 0x5. What is the value of eax after running the
    following instructions?

    mov   ecx,eax
    add   ecx,ecx
    add   ecx,eax
    add   ecx,3h
    mov   eax,ecx


3.  What does the following piece of code does? Assume that the input of this
    code is eax, and the output is eax.

    mov   edx,eax
    add   edx,edx
    add   edx,edx
    add   edx,edx
    sub   edx,eax
    mov   eax,edx


Write some code
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

4.  Assume that you are given values in eax,ebx,ecx. Write code that adds the
    values inside all those registers, and stores the final result inside edx.


5.  Bonus: Write a piece of code that copies the number inside al (Only 8 bits)
    into whole edx, so that the value inside edx will be equal to the value
    inside the original al. Hint: You will have to somehow pad with zeroes the
    original value.

    Example: Assume that Initially eax = 0x153BCF19. When your code will end its
    running, I expect that edx = 0x00000019


6.  Bonus: Assume that you are given values in eax,ecx. Write a piece of code
    that calculates 5*eax + 3*ecx + 1, and stores the result inside eax. (*
    means multiplication here).


7.  Bonus: You are given eax = 0x1. Could you zero eax using only ADD
    instructions? What is the lowest number of ADD instructions that you need to
    use to acheive that result.


8.  Bonus: Could you calculate eax * eax (eax times eax) using only MOV,ADD,SUB
    instructions?


Happy thinking :)
