For hexadecimal arithmetic we use a calculator.

Read some code
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

0.  Assume that the value of eax is 0x3. What is the new value of eax after the
    execution of the following instructions:

    inc   eax
    dec   eax
    inc   eax
    inc   eax

  ANSWER:

    0x5

1.  Assume that initially:
    edx = 0x17, eax = 0x3, esi=0x7
    What are the new values of edx,eax,esi after the execution of the following
    instructions:

    mul   esi
    mul   esi
    mul   si

  ANSWER:

    | edx       | eax       | esi
    ----------------------------------
    | 0x17      | 0x3       | 0x7
    | 0x0       | 0x15      | 0x7       (0000 0003 * 0000 0007)
    | 0x0       | 0x93      | 0x7       (0000 0015 * 0000 0007)
    | 0x0       | 0x405     | 0x7       (0093 * 0007)

2.  Given that:
    edx = 0x0, eax = 0x1A, ecx = 0x3,
    What are the new values of edx,eax,ecx after the execution of the following
    instruction:

    div   ecx

  ANSWER:

    | edx       | eax       | ecx
    ----------------------------------
    | 0x0       | 0x1A      | 0x3
    | 0x2       | 0x8       | 0x3        (0000 0000 0000 001A / 0000 0003)


3.  Given that edx = 0x0, eax=0xAAD, ecx = 0x0,
    What is going to happen as a result of the execution of the following
    instruction:

    div   cx

    Why?

  ANSWER:

    Division by zero is not possible.

    The processor wil produce an error, which gives it to the operating system. The
    operating system can choose how to handle it. In case of Windows it will gives us
    an error notice.



4.  Read the following code and answer the questions:

  4.0   What does this piece of code do?
  
        mov   ecx,eax
        mul   ecx
        
    ANSWER:

      The value of eax is multiplied by eax. It is the same as the power of 2.

  4.1   Bonus: What does this piece of code do? (Input: eax, Output: eax)?

        mov   ecx,eax
        mul   ecx
        mov   esi,eax
        add   ecx,ecx
        add   esi,ecx
        inc   esi
        mov   eax,esi

        - Could you do the same using less instructions?
        - What happens if eax is very large?

    ANSWER:

      Let's try it with an example:

                      | eax      | ecx      | esi
                      ---------------------------------
                      | 0x3      | ????     | ????
        mov   ecx,eax | 0x3      | 0x3      | ????
        mul   ecx     | 0x9      | 0x3      | ????
        mov   esi,eax | 0x9      | 0x3      | 0x9
        add   ecx,ecx | 0x9      | 0x6      | 0x9
        add   esi,ecx | 0x9      | 0x6      | 0xF
        inc   esi     | 0x9      | 0x6      | 0x10
        mov   eax,esi | 0x10     | 0x6      | 0x10

      It moves a few times in registers, but it does basically this:

      f(x) = eax^2 + 2 * eax + 1

      Yes, we can do it in less, when using only one other register to store eax.

                      | eax      | ecx      
                      ----------------------
                      | 0x3      | ????
        mov   ecx,eax | 0x3      | 0x3  
        mul   eax     | 0x9      | 0x3   
        add   eax,ecx | 0xC      | 0x3    
        add   eax,ecx | 0xF      | 0x3     
        inc   eax     | 0x10     | 0x3      

      When eax is very large nothing specials happends with multiplication. When a 
      number is too large to store inside the 32 bit eax register, the result gets 
      wrapped to 32 bits.


  4.2   Bonus: What does this piece of code do? (Input: eax, Output: eax)?
        
        mov   ecx,eax
        inc   eax
        dec   ecx
        mul   ecx

    ANSWER:

      Again, let's try with an example

                      | eax      | ecx    
                      ----------------------
                      | 0x3      | ???
        mov   ecx,eax | 0x3      | 0x3
        inc   eax     | 0x4      | 0x3
        dec   ecx     | 0x4      | 0x2
        mul   ecx     | 0x8      | 0x2          (0000 0002 * 0000 0004)

      It does the following: f(x) = (eax - 1) * (eax + 1)


Write some code
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

5.  
  5.0   Write a piece of code that multiplies the numbers 1,2,3,4,5, and stores
        the result inside eax.

    ANSWER:

      Since we cannot directly multiply with numbers, we need to store it in a register.
      Use ecx as the counter.

      mov eax, 1
      mov ecx, 1
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx

  5.1   Write a similar piece of code which multiplies the numbers 1,2,...,10
        and stores the result inside eax.

    ANSWER:

      mov eax, 1
      mov ecx, 1
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx
      inc ecx
      mul ecx

6.  You are given three numbers eax=a, ebx=b, ecx=c. Write a piece of code that
    calculates their average (a+b+c)/3, and stores it into eax.

  ANSWER:

    add eax, ebx
    add eax, ecx
    mov esi, 3
    div esi


7.  Bonus: You are given eax=a, ebx=b. Calculate (a^3)*b + 5*(b^2), and store
    the result inside eax. (Here * means multiplication, and c^d means c to the
    power of d).

  ANSWER:

    Calculate the first term in eax. Then move eax temporarily to ecx and use eax 
    to calculate ebx and the second term. Then add ecx to eax.

    mul eax       ; eax * eax
    mul eax       ; eax * eax
    mul ebx       ; ebx * eax
    mov ecx, eax  ; store the result temporarily in ecx
    mov eax, ebx  ; move ebx to eax so we can use mul
    mul eax       ; eax * eax
    mov ebx, 5    ; use ebx to store 5
    mul ebx       ; ebx * eax
    add eax, ecx  ; ecx + eax
